# Bubble Twist

Try to remove all bubbles by making pairs of 3 or more of the same color to make them pop. The mass of bubbles will rotate upon the center when hit. If you pop all of bubbles your score multiplier will increase by 1 so that all future pops will be worth more points. Try to get the high score, good luck!
